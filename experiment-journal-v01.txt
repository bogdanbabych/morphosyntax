[[Morphosyntax project]]
Goal: develop a coherent model of 

14/11/2016
The project is developing a cognate identification metric via computing phonological levenshtein distance

Tasks
	- re-engineer matching modules (currently phonological representations is computed many times for the same word in a longer dictionary; cash phonological representation?)

	- write in a 'distributionally clean' way

15/11/2016
next stage:
	error analysis:
		- find the scripts which can trace back for each pair of cognates how phonological distance has been computed


9/12/2016
	principle: keep a run separate in a non-synchronised directory:
		important for multiple non-development related splits...
